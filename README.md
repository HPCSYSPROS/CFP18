HPC Systems Professionals Workshop (HPCSYSPROS18)  
Call For Papers (and artifacts)
--------------- 
HPCSYSPROS18 is held in conjunction with SC18: The International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis.  

Submission Deadline - August 20th

Supercomputing systems present complex challenges to personnel who design, deploy and maintain these systems. Standing up these systems and keeping them running require novel solutions that are unique to high performance computing. The success of any supercomputing center depends on stable and reliable systems, and HPC Systems Professionals are crucial to that success.

The Third Annual HPC Systems Professionals Workshop will bring together systems administrators, systems architects, and systems analysts in order to share best practices, discuss cutting-edge technologies, and advance the state-of-the-practice for HPC systems. This year we will change the format of submissions as well as the submission timeline. While papers will still be suitable for submission we will also be opening the submission proccess to a few different types of artifacts in an effort to align the submissions with the professional discipline of HPC Systems.

Topics of Interest 
--------------- 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Cluster, configuration, or software management 
* Performance tuning/Benchmarking 
* Resource manager and job scheduler configuration 
* Monitoring/Mean-time-to-failure/ROI/Resource utilization 
* Virtualization/Clouds 
* Designing and troubleshooting HPC interconnects 
* Designing and maintaining HPC storage solutions 
* Cybersecurity and data protection

Submission Information
---------------
Authors are invited to submit original, high-quality papers and artifacts with an emphasis on solutions that can be implemented by other members of the HPC systems community.

Papers should be submitted in PDF format and should be between 6 and 8 pages including tables, figures and appendices, but excluding references and reproducibility appendicies. Artifacts should also include abstracts and descriptions from 2-4 pages depending on type, along with other materials. All new submission type requirements are listed below. All papers and abstracts should be formatted according to the IEEE Conference Proceedings template and are required to include a modified reproducibility appendix from SC18. Papers and Artifacts will be published on Github and archived with a DOI in Zenodo. A sample template specific to the workshop is provided here:

New Types of Submissions
---------------

* Architecture Descriptions should include an interesting network, storage or system architecture or a hybrid thereof at a data-center level. It would be documented by multiple arcitecture diagrams and a four page description of the architecture in the provided teplate.

* Small Middleware or Systems Software should include an artifact of code such as a BASH or Python Script. Additionally, there should be strong documentation that would make the artifact usable by community. This documnetation should be written in Markdown and a two page abstract in the SC proceedings format is required.

* System Configuration and Configuration Management should include configuration or configuration management and/or the interactions between multiple configured applications. Examples of this may be a puppet module, a config file used in a unique way, or more likely a group of config files and configuration management bundled together. Strong documentation for reproducing the artifact as well as a two page abstract in the SC proceedings format is required.

Proposals for different types of artifacts than what have been listed will also be accpeted. If you have a type of artifact that is not listed that is relevant, high-quality  and has an emphasis on reproducibility and implementation, then please propose it to the committee. If the committee agrees, the CFP will be amended to reflect the new artifact and it's requrirements. 

Committee contact: contact@hpcsyspros.org  
The up-to-date CFP will always be available at https://github.com/HPCSYSPROS/CFP18.
